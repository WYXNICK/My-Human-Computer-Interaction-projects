# My-Human-Computer-Interaction-projects
These are some of the projects I completed in the user interaction technology course. The assignments are as follows.

## lab1 Automatic Speech Recognition

Add two functions to the program (asr.py), such as

* Play music (tips: `win32api.ShellExecute(0, 'open', 'E:\\song.wma', '','',1)`)
* Open a text file  (tips: `win32api.ShellExecute(0, 'open', 'notepad.exe', '','',0)`)
* Any other function you’d like to implement

You can find many examples of how to call external commands in python on the web

## lab2 Image Search System

 Design and implement an image search system (interface) according to the Five-Stage Framework

 The searching interface has the following features:

* It contains an input box to upload an image (Formulation); 
* Users can preview the query image in the searching window (Formulation);
* It has a search button (Initiation); 
* Provide an overview of the results (e.g. the total number of results) (Review);
* Allow changing search parameters (e.g. select certain category/tag) when reviewing results (Refinement);
* Users can take some actions, e.g. add selected images to a favorite list (Use);
* Other functions you would like to add in.

## lab3 Data Visualization

 Design and implement a Dashboard for one of three datasets

 The dashboard should contain at least three graphs (e.g. scatter plot, bar chart, pie chart, line chart, etc) which reveal certain information respectively.

* It’s not necessary to visualize all the columns/rows of the dataset. You can choose only several of them.
